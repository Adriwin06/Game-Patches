# Game-Patches
Games patches I wrote. Currently focused on Burnout Paradise.

## Introduction
I'm still learning Reverse Engineering with IDA Pro, so it might only be small changes for now, and maybe not done in the best way, but this can only improve in the future ðŸ˜Š

## Patches

### Increased Cars LODs Distance
Increase the LODs distance for the vehicles including traffic. It has only been increased by a factor of 5x because the game really don't like too high values for this.
