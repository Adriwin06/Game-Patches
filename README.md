# Game-Patches
Games patches I wrote. Currently focused on Burnout Paradise.

## Introduction
I'm still learning Reverse Engineering with IDA Pro, so it might only be small changes for now, and maybe not done in the best way, but this can only improve in the future ðŸ˜Š

## Patches
In the `BURNOUT_ARTIST.XEX` executable of the [Jan 30,2008 prototype](https://hiddenpalace.org/Burnout_Paradise_(Jan_30,_2008_prototype)) of Burnout Paradise
###  Disable Performances Monitors
This will disable the FPS counter as well as the three thread monitors.

### Increased Cars LODs Distance
This will increase the LODs distance for the cars.
