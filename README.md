# Game-Patches
Games patches I wrote. Will probably only be for Burnout Paradise.

## Introduction
I'm still learning Reverse Engineering with IDA Pro, so it might only be small changes for now, and maybe not done in the best way, but this can only improve in the future ðŸ˜Š

## Patches
###  Disable Performances Monitors
This will disable the FPS counter as well as the three thread monitors in the `BURNOUT_ARTIST.XEX` executable of the [Jan 30,2008 prototype](https://hiddenpalace.org/Burnout_Paradise_(Jan_30,_2008_prototype)) of Burnout Paradise.
