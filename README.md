# Game-Patches
Games patches I wrote. Currently focused on Burnout Paradise.

## Introduction
I'm still learning Reverse Engineering with IDA Pro, so it might only be small changes for now, and maybe not done in the best way, but this can only improve in the future üòä

## Patches
In the `BURNOUT_ARTIST.XEX` executable of the [Jan 30,2008 prototype](https://hiddenpalace.org/Burnout_Paradise_(Jan_30,_2008_prototype)) of Burnout Paradise
###  Disable Performances Monitors üü•üü©üü©

### Increased Cars LODs Distance
Increase the LODs distance for the vehicles including traffic. It has only been increased by a factor of 5x because the game really don't like too high values for this.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This patch can greatly affect the game performance depending on how you run the game without the patch. And higher values than 5x can greatly decrease the performance even on high-end hardware: the game is not optimized for this.

### Forced Random Soundtrack Play Order
By default, the game plays the soundtrack in the sequential order, and if you change your settings to random and relaunch the game, it default back to sequential. This is a problem with all user settings, not just play order (I plan to fix this). This patch forces the game to play the songs in a **random order** *regardless of the settings*.
